- increase test coverage.
   - test Encrypted+non-encrypted cases
   - test all the operator x= cases.
- Add missing math.h functions (see SHEMath.cpp).
- Add SHEString
- Add Unordered_map:
  - a version that stores the components unencrypted, but are retrieved
    encrypted.
- Improve FP performance by switching from offset to native exp, and
  tracking nan and inf status with separate bools.
- Create detailed documentation on each function
- Create 3, 4, 5, and 6 variable versions of needRecrypt, verifyArgs, and
  reCrypt.
- Add Debugging Summary to SHEVector
- Complete the GenericContext code
- Add Vector operations
   - use slots in SHEInt to intialize it with a vector.
   - disable packed recrypt when using vectors. (Question does the underlying
     add/multiply use backed slots as well?)
   - export SHEInt as vectors.
   - Add vector support to SHEFp (same plan as SHEInt)
   - Add vector support to SHEString
- Add Support for non-binary BGV contexts
- Add Support for CVV
